As an introduction to responsiveness, this project taught me how to use an iframe, as well as using size and srcset to display 
images based on screen size. The first thing a user experiences when loading a page is the view. We want to present
them with a UI that aquires their attention. This project indtroduced principals that help establish that connection.
